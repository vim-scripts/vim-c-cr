vim-c-cr
A very simple and small (eighteen lines of vimscript) plugin that maps ctrl+enter (<c-cr>) in insert mode to finish braces ({}), brackets ([]) and parentheses (()) for you and puts your cursor tabbed over on a blank line between them.

So,

{<c-cr>
or
[<c-cr>
or
(<c-cr>
will give you

{
  <your cursor here>
}
or
[
  <your cursor here>
]
or
(
  <your cursor here>
)

DISCLAIMER

This only works with gvim!
